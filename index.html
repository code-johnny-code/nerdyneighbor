<h1>Nerdy Neighbor</h1>
<p class="tagline">Polite. Professional. Local. Veteran-owned.</p>

<h2>What I Do</h2>
<p>I help with everyday tech problems at home—Wi-Fi that won’t connect, printers that refuse to print, computers that act up, or getting your streaming or email working again. If it plugs in and frustrates you, I’ll take a look.</p>

<p><strong>Service Area:</strong> I proudly serve Eureka Springs and the surrounding areas. If you're within a 30-minute drive, you're in the zone! For travel beyond that, we may need to discuss a small additional fee to cover time in transit.</p>

<h2>Pricing</h2>

<h3>Home Visit Rates</h3>
<p>Most tech issues can be solved during the initial visit window. If it looks like we’ll need more time, I’ll always check with you before continuing.</p>
<p>Every home visit includes a quick cleanup with compressed air—removing dust from computers, routers, and other equipment that might be hiding in hot, dusty corners. It’s a small step that can make a big difference in speed and reliability—and it helps keep your devices running longer.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>$100</strong> – Up to 90 minutes at your home</li>
  <li><strong>$50</strong> – Each additional 30 minutes</li>
</ul>
<p>Cash and checks gladly accepted.</p>

<h3>Off-Site Repairs</h3>
<p>If it’s more convenient, I can take your device with me to repair off-site. We’ll always agree on the work and estimated cost in advance. Turnaround is typically 1–3 business days, depending on the issue.</p>

<h2>Reasonable Expectations</h2>
<p>I do my best to treat every device like it’s my own, and most of the time, everything goes just fine. That said, technology can be unpredictable—especially when it’s already acting up.</p>

<p>When you invite me into your home or hand off a device, you’re trusting me to give it my full attention, care, and honesty. I’ll never push something you don’t need, and I’ll always talk through the plan before doing anything extra.</p>

<h3>What I Promise</h3>
<ul>
  <li>I’ll show up when I say I will</li>
  <li>I’ll explain things clearly and honestly</li>
  <li>I’ll respect your home and your time</li>
  <li>If I can’t fix it, I’ll tell you straight</li>
  <li>If I make a mistake, I’ll make it right</li>
</ul>

<h3>What You Should Know</h3>
<ul>
  <li>I can’t guarantee I’ll be able to fix everything</li>
  <li>Sometimes devices fail on their own, especially if they’re already on their way out</li>
  <li>Data loss, manufacturer defects, or internet outages might be outside my control</li>
</ul>

<p>If I need to take something with me to work on, we’ll agree on what needs doing first—and I’ll keep you in the loop every step of the way.</p>
<p>My goal is always the same: solve the problem, keep it simple, and make sure you feel good about the help you got.</p>
