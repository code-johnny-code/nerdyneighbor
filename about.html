<p>I'm John Ross, founder of Nerdy Neighbor. I grew up right here in Eureka Springs and graduated from the high school in 2004. After that, I joined the Marine Corps and served in Intelligence, where I learned to solve problems calmly, quickly, and creatively—even in the toughest situations.</p>

<p>After the Marines, I worked in tech professionally for over a decade. My wife (also a Eureka native) and I moved our family back home in 2022 and built our house from the ground up.</p>

<p>Nerdy Neighbor was born from a simple idea:<br><strong>People need tech help they can actually trust.</strong></p>

<p>Whether you're struggling with Wi-Fi or wondering what kind of laptop to buy, I’m here to help—no jargon, no pressure, no upsells.</p>

<p>I believe in clear pricing, showing up on time, and treating every customer like a neighbor—because you are.</p>
