<h1>Email Support – Membership Guide</h1>

<h2>Included with Your $25/Month Membership:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Unlimited email support for non-urgent tech questions, how-tos, and follow-ups</li>
  <li>Guaranteed response within 1 business day (often much faster)</li>
  <li>10% discount on in-home visits</li>
  <li>Flexible, member-first scheduling</li>
  <li>Pay for a year up front and get a discounted rate of $250/year — that's $50 in savings, or like getting 2 months free!</li>
</ul>

<h2>What You Can Expect from Me:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Replies within 1 business day (often faster, but never more than 24 hours)</li>
  <li>I’ll help as much as I can over email, and if an in-person visit is needed, we’ll get you scheduled</li>
</ul>

<h2>What's Best for Email Support:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>“How do I...” questions</li>
  <li>Follow-up questions from a recent visit</li>
  <li>Help picking equipment</li>
  <li>Device recommendations or setup steps</li>
  <li>Account recovery tips</li>
  <li>General tech advice</li>
</ul>

<h2>What Email Can't Cover:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Live troubleshooting</li>
  <li>Diagnosing hardware/network issues</li>
  <li>Emergency support (e.g., internet outage, POS failure)</li>
  <li>Phone or screen sharing support</li>
</ul>

<h2>If It's Too Complex for Email:</h2>
<p>If the issue can’t be resolved via email in a few steps, I’ll recommend scheduling a home visit at your discounted rate. Email support is for light guidance—not full-service remote repair.</p>
